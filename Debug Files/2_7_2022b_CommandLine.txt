NOTES:

The C code was written so that stop acquisition and flush buffers were placed inside the acquisition loop, after requeue buffer. 
This method caused a memory error in running the C code and the code ran noticeably slower.
It appears that this method produces a "Valid lines from frame" of 358 with no lines lost. Not sure why this is.
